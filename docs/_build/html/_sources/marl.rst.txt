Experimenting with MARL
=======================

The problems available in COGNAC are dedicated to multi-agent reinforcement learning and promote the development of distributed RL methods. Indeed, available environments focus on minimal problem that are scalable to very large network structure.
We provide some benchmark experiments and standard algorithms implementation directly adapted from the excellent `Clean-RL <https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl>`_.
